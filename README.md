This project requires JUCE to complile and run.

## Usage

Open XDLightScope.jucer using the ProJucer tool.
An exporter for XCode has already been created. If you're using Windows, you'll need to create an exporter for your favourite IDE.
Compile the project after exporting a project using ProJucer.

## Testing

So far, I have only tested this on MacOS Ventura 13.6.3 using Juce 7.0.9.
Builds fail using Juce 7.0.10.
Please get in touch if you test this in any other situation so I can update this readme.
